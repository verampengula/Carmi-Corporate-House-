The project is to create a user-friendly travel agency website with a comprehensive booking system for flights, hotels, car rentals, and tours, including advanced search filters. Users can create profiles, receive personalized recommendations, and make secure payments. The website will provide detailed destination information, travel packages, deals, curated itineraries, and a dynamic travel blog. Robust customer support, social media integration, SEO optimization, analytics, and security measures will be implemented for an engaging and secure user experience. Regular maintenance will ensure the website remains up-to-date and responsive to user needs and market trends.
